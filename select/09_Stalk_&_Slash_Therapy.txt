Don't look now, don't look now, don't look now, he's hiding in the shadows
With his little book, with his little book, with his little book, he's hiding in the shadows

Don't look now, don't look now, don't look now, she's hiding in the shadows
With her little book, with her little book, with her little book, she's hiding in the shadows
